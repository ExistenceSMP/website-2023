            ## About Us

            Welcome to the **Existence SMP Community**! We're an online Minecraft community established March 20th, 2016. \
            \
            Over the past 7 years we've had three YouTube-based series and three smaller "Project" series. We're now on our second Community Server, focusing on building a more open Minecraft community.

## Legacy Seasons _(2016—2018)_

In March of 2016, we launched what is now known as Existence SMP Legacy Season 1. LS1 would lead to two other "Legacy" seasons before we switched to the community focus that we have today. \
\
The Legacy seasons were focused primarily on YouTube content creation. Visit our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/ExistenceSMP/playlists) to view the playlists that were created for these seasons! \
\
These seasons will always be a key part of Existence SMP history. Without them, we wouldn't have built the community that powers today's [Community Server](/community)!

## Existence Podcast _(2017—Present)_

The Existence Podcast began with Legacy Season 2. We try to release monthly episodes hosted by Existence SMP Community members and a range of guests. \
\
We use the podcast to keep community members up to date with current happenings, behind the scenes, the latest Minecraft news, and more. It is a casual podcast to listen to while sitting back, relaxing, getting some work done, or playing a bit of Minecraft. \
\
Check the latest episodes on the [Podcast](/podcast) page or the YouTube playlist below.
