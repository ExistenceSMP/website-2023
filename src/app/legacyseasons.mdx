## Legacy Seasons _(2016â€”2018)_

In March of 2016, we launched what is now known as Existence SMP Legacy Season 1. LS1 would lead to two other "Legacy" seasons before we switched to the community focus that we have today. \
\
The Legacy seasons were focused primarily on YouTube content creation. Visit our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/ExistenceSMP/playlists) to view the playlists that were created for these seasons! \
\
These seasons will always be a key part of Existence SMP history. Without them, we wouldn't have built the community that powers today's [Community Server](/community)!
