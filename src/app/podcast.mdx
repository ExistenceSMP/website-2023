## Existence Podcast _(2017â€”Present)_

The Existence Podcast began with Legacy Season 2. We try to release monthly episodes hosted by Existence SMP Community members and a range of guests. \
\
We use the podcast to keep community members up to date with current happenings, behind the scenes, the latest Minecraft news, and more. It is a casual podcast to listen to while sitting back, relaxing, getting some work done, or playing a bit of Minecraft. \

Check the latest episodes on the [Podcast](/podcast) page or the YouTube playlist below.
