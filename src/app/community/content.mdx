## Community Server

The Community Server is the **core of Existence SMP**. Our community has grown beyond what any one of us could have imagined since 2016. The Community Server was started in 2020, marking a new era of Existence. \
\
We are currently on **Community Server 2**, which launched on March 20th, 2022, following the release of Minecraft 1.18. The server is running **Minecraft 1.19.3** via [Paper](https://papermc.io).

## Proximity Voice Chat

The Community Server is also running [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat), an optional mod that allows players to communicate via proximity voice chat in-game without the need for other applications like Discord. \
\
For help setting this up, check [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSiIOFOYjvosp2ysuLay-0lUIaesHuoucew6imTkCQsiC82IMjU8HdIqsMFNjcHKzRuToGqCUrorBWm/pub) or contact one of our Staff & Support members in our [Discord](https://existencesmp.com/discord) server.
